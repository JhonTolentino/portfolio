  <p class="mega">Infographics are an amazing way to convey statistics but, with all technological advances they’ve not revolutionized. Simply put infographics have more or less merged their identities to print design, which is fine to a certain degree. But remembering the fact that most people are visual learners having a stagnate illustration isn’t nearly enough.</p>

      <p class="island-1-2">Infographics have a ton of potential with all the new programs that designers have at their fingertips. With beautiful animated elements a normally stagnate infographic has now evolved into an informative eye-catching video.</p>

      <p class="island-1-2">With some improvements to interactive design, the audience can now control which part of poster is revealed. This incredibly helps layouts since only pieces of the information will be presented when certain actions have been performed.</p>
