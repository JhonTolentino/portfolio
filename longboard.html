  <p class="mega island push-none">Product branding is an ever-growing business that has not revolutionized itself through the centuries. With new tech improvements each year design has relatively stayed the same with very little changes. With new tech developments each year mixing design with tech could really change how we approach design.</p>
  <p class="mega island">Through research of the general longboard demographic, by adding qr codes that can act as a form of business card can easily change how we brand. Having the code directly bring the users back to the creators site and having some user interactivity can enhance the value of the product and design immensely.</p>
